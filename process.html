                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This version of Rhythmscape looks a bit more
                    like what we know it as now. This has two players - one player with a stomp board, and another with
                    control over the mouse - working together to hit notes on beat. Both players have their own “screen” to
                    pay attention to, and each note requires both players stomping to be hit successfully. Notes come in every
                    four beats of a song, and players must maneuver the mouse to the right location and hit the right color of
                    button.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This iteration of Rhythmscape built upon the
                    strongest elements of version 0.1, refining them into a more cohesive experience by placing both players
                    on the same screen. This change enhanced visual clarity and encouraged greater collaboration between
                    players. It also fundamentally redefined the gameplay dynamics: the player using the mouse now assumes the
                    role of the &#34;protector,&#34; enabling the stomping player to engage effectively by revealing buttons,
                    facilitating note hits, and supporting overall playability. This version is very close to the final design
                    and represents a significant improvement over all previous iterations.

            <p class="the-inspiration-for">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inspiration for Rhythmscape came from other
                awesome rhythm games like Hi-Fi Rush, Dance Dance Revolution, Crypt of the Necrodancer, and many more.
                Rhythmscape began as a top-down dungeon crawler with enemies and movement based on a square grid. The player
                would dodge attacks, swing at enemies, collect coins, and much more all on the beat. This idea evolved into
                a two player game, where one player would control the attacks and the other would control movement. This
                gameplay loop didn’t serve the “rhythm game” concept super well, though, and most of the ideas were
                scrapped.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first version of the dance pad pales in
                        comparison with what it eventually became. Starting small, we focused on quick iterations to find out
                        what was working and what wasn’t. We had plenty of play-testing even at this point, playing a video of
                        our early versions of the game while people stomped around on buttons that didn’t really do anything.
                        This information was vital in refining the final design.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique requirements of our game required
                    unique solutions. Creating custom wiring with tinfoil and a Teensy micro controller enabled full control
                    over the capabilities of our controller. From cutting the tinfoil to the size and layout of foil, and even
                    the type of tape used for adhering our wires, each step of the process needed to be adapted to our stomp
                    pad and the needs of our project. This controller was made to take a literal stomping and maintain its
                    consistency and accuracy.

                    controller is the feel of using it. We designed a multi-layer layout that would allow for seamless
                    connection of our buttons on the top of the board while also aligning with guides on the frame underneath.
                    Fine tuning the “squish” and rebound of the buttons required particular placement and depth of special
                    rubber strips.

            features all of the art by Nefeli, our wonderful artist. This small process blog does not encompass even one
            percent of all of the hours spent this semester on Rhythmscape - frustrating, exhausting, wonderful hours.
            Game development and programming in general is like any other creative endeavor in that it is incredibly
            frustrating and incredibly rewarding at the same time. Nothing is worse than banging your head against a wall
            trying to fix the same bug for days, and nothing feels better than finally figuring it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Working
            on Rhythmscape has taught me about honesty, about scope creep, about my own weaknesses, my own strengths, my
            interests, and even one or two things about game development.

                    more enjoyable than each version that came before it. The bright colors pop, the buttons squish and
                    rebound in a satisfying manner, and the game pushes you to hop and stomp in engaging patterns. Our goal
                    for this controller was to make you feel like you were playing from inside the game, and it hit all of our
                    heuristics.

                new rounds of challenges to overcome, like grounding sneaky static electricity that was building up beneath
                the buttons. A lot of work went into testing and refining the size of the board to feel large enough that it
                gets you moving, yet small enough to navigate easily. We also needed to build in squares for stability while
                integrating with our smooth curves of the buttons above.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first steps in creating our motion sensed
                    guitar-staff controller was developing a simple tracking script. It turned out to be much more than
                    simple. Over a month or so, and a few dozen different python scripts, we tried color detection, Kinect
                    motion sensing, and then finally landed on infrared imaging which also gives the controller a sweet red
                    glow coming from the top. Using infrared and a bright light source allows the game to be played in all
                    kinds of different lighting conditions. It is consistent and clear in its implementation, letting the
                    player discover the input and explore it throughout the gameplay.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our imaging script, we just needed a
                rocking guitar. An infrared build is more than enough to track the position of the tip of the guitar within
                space, which we can instantly convert to a screen position in game. With the controllers matching up with
                the in game models, it is fun and immersive just to pick up the guitar or hop up on the stomp pad. The game
                invites you to contort your body and get into your best rock star poses to maximize the points you can gain.

                    sketches which I turned over to THE SCULPTOR. In the story we follow siblings Stephanie and Mike who
                    accidentally unleash Tone Death. This shadowy villain seeks to erase music from history, leaving the world
                    in silence. Our young heroes must travel across the Rhythmscape, freeing the musical genres of history
                    from Tone Death’s grasp. With each victory, their Walkman gains new power, leading them to a final
                    showdown in their hometown Chicago to save the world from eternal silence. It was important to me and the
                    whole team that the aesthetic and story would be represented in the controllers.

                    with ideas when we hit roadblocks in game design and controllers. One of the most important roles I had
                    was gathering information from play testing. I was fortunate enough to coach a boys basketball team with
                    the exact age demographic we wanted for our game. I spent many hours coming up with fixes in game and out
                    of the game from this feedback so that Rhythmscape 99 would be the game we know and love today.

                which two players have separate controllers to play as one character within the game. This idea quickly
                snowballed into a rhythm game. As Game Director I gathered a group of people with expertise in all the
