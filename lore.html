                    <p class="stephanie-and-mike">
                        Stephanie and Mike live in Chicago with their parents who both work corporate jobs. They visit their
                        grandmother in a small suburban outskirt town in Illinois called Green Pines. This quaint town does not have
                        the same hustle and bustle as the city so Stephanie and Mike often get very bored visiting. <br />Inside
                        Grandma’s house is a treasure trove of antiques. An old record player softly plays an old tune that they
                        can’t quite make out. Grandma, full of warmth, sends them to the attic to fetch decorations. She warns them
                        to not dilly dally as there are many antiquities that could break. The children supposedly head this
                        warning. In the attic, amidst dusty trunks and heirlooms, the siblings discover a carved wooden cabinet.
                        Inside lies a glowing, crystalized medallion with intricate musical engravings. Along with old sheet music a
                        plethora of instruments and what appears to be a broken guitar. Curious, they accidentally shatter the
                        medallion while gesturing with it as if it is as magical artifact. The room plunges into darkness, and the
                        record player’s song warps into a haunting melody.

                        The player is first introduced to the Rhythmscape through another music player artifact, this time a stereo
                        cd player. The seemingly mundane action of putting on some music suddenly glitches the entire world into
                        multi-color and the player is suddenly thrust into the Rhythmscape. The player can only continue forward at
                        this point and complete the journey into the Rhythmscape to fight the battles against Tone Death.<br />Below
                        are some of the animation key-frames for the introduction sequence.

                <p class="stephanie-s">
                    Stephanie ‘s character traits or identifiers are brave, occasionally rash/impetuous, strong, protective,
                    humorous/fun but can also be more serious, and disinterested. Those traits are then imbued into the poses,
                    clothing, and coloring choices for Stephanie’s character design. She is seen as relatively aloof but also
                    worried and judgmental in some frames. <br />The process typically begins with a red line gesture sketch where
                    the overall body proportions are established as well as the pose. A black line sketch is superimposed on top
                    where the clothing and styling of the character is created. That black line character sketch is the basis for
                    the final outline.
                </p>
                <p class="text-wrapper-18">
                    In our game, the two main characters are essentially cheerleaders off to the sides of the screen, dancing and
                    moving to the beat. This was achieved through frame by frame animations where both characters have the most
                    movement occurring on the fourth frame. When pairing this with the music in game, the bpm of the song/60 = the
                    number of beats per second, which then becomes the number of frames per second that the animation plays at.

                            On the other hand, the stomp player, Mike (Stephanie’s younger brother) has more timid character traits
                            and identifiers such as: curiousness, nervousness, a more timid nature, cleverness, and being witty (at
                            least when interacting with his sister). <br /><br />The two characters needed to have distinct colorings
                            but also be similar enough to make it clear that they are siblings. Mike is also decently younger than
                            Stephanie and that needed to be visible in the body proportions as well.

                        emerges, a being of living silence and discord. The siblings notice that as he nears the record player, the
                        melody becomes more and more muted, eventually converting into the static hum of grey noise. Looming over
                        Stephanie and Mike, he announces his plan to erase each genre of music from existence, leaving the current
                        world in darkness and silence. He begins by scattering the medallion shards across time to disrupt the flow
                        of musical history.<br />Before vanishing, Tone Death warns them that their world will soon fall into
                        silence and chaos. He lunges at the children violently but the guitar from the cabinet flies over and emits
                        a strong red light. Tone Death winces as the light hits him and vanishes as quickly as he awakened. As he
                        disappears, one shard of the medallion remains hidden in Mikes pocket. Stephanie decides to hold onto the
                        guitar, setting the strap about her shoulders, and they make their way downstairs.<br />As the kids rush
                        downstairs to warn their Grandma and parents about the shrouded figure they encountered, they hear the keys
                        of a piano playing from their neighbors house. Suddenly the shard in Mike’s pocket begins to grow unbearably
                        warm. Mike reaches into his pocket throws the shard against the ground, where it grows into a glowing
                        portal, sweeping the siblings into a whirlwind of light. Their vision turns orange, and Stephanie can only
                        think to hold onto her brother and the guitar with all her strength.</span

                    You and a friend are transported back to 1999 in this two-player arcade rhythm game. One of you will dodge
                    attacks and keep the rhythm by stomping on a dance board, while the other defends from musical mishaps while
                    waving a motion-detected ir guitar. Together you will fight through various musical genres to defeat the evil
                    Tone Death and free the world from eternal silence. With every successful completion of a level Stephanie and
                    Mike’s Walkman gains new power, leading them to a final showdown in their hometown Chicago to save the world

                        throughout the game with noise filters and shaders. Particularly in the final level, titled “Tone Death” the

                        been&nbsp;&nbsp;possessed by the spirit of Tone Death in the classical level, trying to stop the players and

                    tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite stylized but still is recognizable as a mundane desk, a flickering monitor, and
                    interesting lighting creeping through to light the scene. As the player progresses through the game more and
                    more spray paint, glitch, and grunge motifs occur in the artwork. Whereas the characters stay in the style of
                    solid colors with action lines. This conveys how the characters, ordinary siblings, are stuck in this
                    otherworldly space where they don’t belong, the Rhythmscape. This start menu, before the characters are thrust
                    into their adventure reflects that mundane world as well.

                    There’s a common theme throughout Rhythmscape 99 of physical music media and players. Stephanie and Mike’s
                    Walkman is a source of mystical power collecting songs and the musical genres they free, and the cassette
                    player plays into tho this theming by its ability to pause an epic battle through the Rhythmscape, or in this
                    case, the actual game.

                    Each of the levels represent a different era of music: classical, jazz, rock, hip-hop, and modern day. Each of
                    these eras is represented by a color and culminates into the modern day battle with Tone Death as multicolored
                    noise. <br />Each of these levels has a custom shader attached to them, which bathes the characters and all
                    the graphics in a colored glow associated with that level. Classical is a warm wood sort of orange. Jazz is a
                    cool blue. Rock is a bright, reddish purple. Hip-hop is a neon green. And Tone Death is a culmination of all
                    of them.
