Those traits are then imbued into the poses, clothing, and coloring choices for Stephanie’s character design. She is seen as relatively aloof but also worried and judgmental in some frames. <br/>The process typically begins with a red line gesture sketch where the overall body proportions are established as well as the pose. A black line sketch is superimposed on top where the clothing and styling of the character is created. That black line character sketch is the basis for the final outline.</div>
    <div style="width: 763px; left: 97px; top: 5416px; position: absolute; color: black; font-size: 20px; font-family: IBM Plex Sans; font-weight: 400; line-height: 31px; word-wrap: break-word">In our game, the two main characters are essentially cheerleaders off to the sides of the screen, dancing and moving to the beat. This was achieved through frame by frame animations where both characters have the most movement occurring on the fourth frame. When pairing this with the music in game, the bpm of the song/60 = the number of beats per second, which then becomes the number of frames per second that the animation plays at.</div>

  his sister). <br/><br/>The two characters needed to have distinct colorings but also be similar enough to make it clear that they are siblings. Mike is also decently younger than Stephanie and that needed to be visible in the body proportions as well.</div>

They visit their grandmother in a small suburban outskirt town in Illinois called Green Pines. This quaint town does not have the same hustle and bustle as the city so Stephanie and Mike often get very bored visiting. <br/>Inside Grandma’s house is a treasure trove of antiques. An old record player softly plays an old tune that they can’t quite make out. Grandma, full of warmth, sends them to the attic to fetch decorations. She warns them to not dilly dally as there are many antiquities that could break. The children supposedly head this warning. In the attic, amidst dusty trunks and heirlooms, the siblings discover a carved wooden cabinet. Inside lies a glowing, crystalized medallion with intricate musical engravings. Along with old sheet music a plethora of instruments and what appears to be a broken guitar. Curious, they accidentally shatter the medallion while gesturing with it as if it is as magical artifact. The room plunges into darkness, and the record player’s song warps into a haunting melody.<br/><br/></div>

The siblings notice that as he nears the record player, the melody becomes more and more muted, eventually converting into the static hum of grey noise. Looming over Stephanie and Mike, he announces his plan to erase each genre of music from existence, leaving the current world in darkness and silence. He begins by scattering the medallion shards across time to disrupt the flow of musical history.<br/>Before vanishing, Tone Death warns them that their world will soon fall into silence and chaos. He lunges at the children violently but the guitar from the cabinet flies over and emits a strong red light. Tone Death winces as the light hits him and vanishes as quickly as he awakened. As he disappears, one shard of the medallion remains hidden in Mikes pocket. Stephanie decides to hold onto the guitar, setting the strap about her shoulders, and they make their way downstairs.<br/>As the kids rush downstairs to warn their Grandma and parents about the shrouded figure they encountered, they hear the keys of a piano playing from their neighbors house. Suddenly the shard in Mike’s pocket begins to grow unbearably warm. Mike reaches into his pocket throws the shard against the ground, where it grows into a glowing portal, sweeping the siblings into a whirlwind of light. Their vision turns orange, and Stephanie can only think to hold onto her brother and the guitar with all her strength.</span></div>

His staff is both a pause button and music staff final endline. Tone Death’s design is supposed to be otherworldly and almost reverent as he views his task of ending all music as noble and a higher mission.<br/>There are homages to Tone Death throughout the game with noise filters and shaders. Particularly in the final level, titled “Tone Death” the words begin to glitch and the siblings Walkman’s screen begins to flicker. <br/> </div>

Which means that’s the only piece of information to clue the player into what is about to happen. In this piece I wanted it to feel mysterious, almost a foreboding tone.  It is quite stylized but still is recognizable as a mundane desk, a flickering monitor, and interesting lighting creeping through to light the scene. As the player progresses through the game more and more spray paint, glitch, and grunge motifs occur in the artwork. Whereas the characters stay in the style of solid colors with action lines. This conveys how the characters, ordinary siblings, are stuck in this otherworldly space where they don’t belong, the Rhythmscape. This start menu, before the characters are thrust into their adventure reflects that mundane world as well.</div>
