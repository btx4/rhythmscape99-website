            <p class="stephanie-and-mike">
              Stephanie and Mike live in Chicago with their parents who both work corporate jobs. They visit their
              grandmother in a small suburban outskirt town in Illinois called Green Pines. This quaint town does not
              have the same hustle and bustle as the city so Stephanie and Mike often get very bored visiting.
              <br />Inside Grandma’s house is a treasure trove of antiques. An old record player softly plays an old
              tune that they can’t quite make out. Grandma, full of warmth, sends them to the attic to fetch
              decorations. She warns them to not dilly dally as there are many antiquities that could break. The
              children supposedly head this warning. In the attic, amidst dusty trunks and heirlooms, the siblings
              discover a carved wooden cabinet. Inside lies a glowing, crystalized medallion with intricate musical
              engravings. Along with old sheet music a plethora of instruments and what appears to be a broken
              guitar. Curious, they accidentally shatter the medallion while gesturing with it as if it is as magical
              artifact. The room plunges into darkness, and the record player’s song warps into a haunting melody.

              The hooded figure Tone Death is the ultimate villain in the Rhythmscape. His staff is both a pause button
              and music staff final endline. Tone Death’s design is supposed to be otherworldly and almost reverent as
              he views his task of ending all music as noble and a higher mission.<br />There are homages to Tone Death
              throughout the game with noise filters and shaders. Particularly in the final level, titled “Tone Death”
              the words begin to glitch and the siblings Walkman’s screen begins to flicker.

              Featured above is “The Conductor” a villain that is unfortunately not seen in game in Rhythmscape 99. He
              has been&nbsp;&nbsp;possessed by the spirit of Tone Death in the classical level, trying to stop the
              players and characters from freeing classical music from Tone Death’s grasp.

          <p class="stephanie-s">
            Stephanie ‘s character traits or identifiers are brave, occasionally rash/impetuous, strong, protective,
            humorous/fun but can also be more serious, and disinterested. Those traits are then imbued into the poses,
            clothing, and coloring choices for Stephanie’s character design. She is seen as relatively aloof but also
            worried and judgmental in some frames. <br />The process typically begins with a red line gesture sketch
            where the overall body proportions are established as well as the pose. A black line sketch is superimposed
            on top where the clothing and styling of the character is created. That black line character sketch is the
            basis for the final outline.
          </p>
          <p class="text-wrapper-15">
            In our game, the two main characters are essentially cheerleaders off to the sides of the screen, dancing
            and moving to the beat. This was achieved through frame by frame animations where both characters have the
            most movement occurring on the fourth frame. When pairing this with the music in game, the bpm of the
            song/60 = the number of beats per second, which then becomes the number of frames per second that the
            animation plays at.

                On the other hand, the stomp player, Mike (Stephanie’s younger brother) has more timid character traits
                and identifiers such as: curiousness, nervousness, a more timid nature, cleverness, and being witty (at
                least when interacting with his sister). <br /><br />The two characters needed to have distinct
                colorings but also be similar enough to make it clear that they are siblings. Mike is also decently
                younger than Stephanie and that needed to be visible in the body proportions as well.

              emerges, a being of living silence and discord. The siblings notice that as he nears the record player,
              the melody becomes more and more muted, eventually converting into the static hum of grey noise. Looming
              over Stephanie and Mike, he announces his plan to erase each genre of music from existence, leaving the
              current world in darkness and silence. He begins by scattering the medallion shards across time to disrupt
              the flow of musical history.<br />Before vanishing, Tone Death warns them that their world will soon fall
              into silence and chaos. He lunges at the children violently but the guitar from the cabinet flies over and
              emits a strong red light. Tone Death winces as the light hits him and vanishes as quickly as he awakened.
              As he disappears, one shard of the medallion remains hidden in Mikes pocket. Stephanie decides to hold
              onto the guitar, setting the strap about her shoulders, and they make their way downstairs.<br />As the
              kids rush downstairs to warn their Grandma and parents about the shrouded figure they encountered, they
              hear the keys of a piano playing from their neighbors house. Suddenly the shard in Mike’s pocket begins to
              grow unbearably warm. Mike reaches into his pocket throws the shard against the ground, where it grows
              into a glowing portal, sweeping the siblings into a whirlwind of light. Their vision turns orange, and
              Stephanie can only think to hold onto her brother and the guitar with all her strength.</span

            You and a friend are transported back to 1999 in this two-player arcade rhythm game. One of you will dodge
            attacks and keep the rhythm by stomping on a dance board, while the other defends from musical mishaps while
            waving a motion-detected ir guitar. Together you will fight through various musical genres to defeat the

            Stephanie and Mike’s Walkman gains new power, leading them to a final showdown in their hometown Chicago to

            The start menu appears in the game after the intro. Which means that’s the only piece of information to clue
            the player into what is about to happen. In this piece I wanted it to feel mysterious, almost a foreboding
            tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite stylized but still is recognizable as a mundane desk, a flickering monitor, and
            interesting lighting creeping through to light the scene. As the player progresses through the game more and
            more spray paint, glitch, and grunge motifs occur in the artwork. Whereas the characters stay in the style
            of solid colors with action lines. This conveys how the characters, ordinary siblings, are stuck in this
            otherworldly space where they don’t belong, the Rhythmscape. This start menu, before the characters are
            thrust into their adventure reflects that mundane world as well.
